# magic-square-generation-and-verification
This is a program to generate and verify a magic square. A magic square is a square of numbers that have the same sum of rows, columns and diagonals. 
Users enter a number n that specifies the dimension of the square. Then the generate_magic.c generates a magic square that have the dimension n*n. 
To verify the magic square is correct, users can run the verify_magic.c and will get "true" printed if the magic square is correct and "false" printed otherwise.
